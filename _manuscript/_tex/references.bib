	abstract = {The interaction between fiscal and monetary policy is analyzed by means of a game theory approach. The coordination between these two policies is essential, since decisions taken by one institution may have disastrous effects on the other one, resulting in welfare loss for the society. We derived optimal monetary and fiscal policies in context of three coordination schemes: when each institution independently minimizes its welfare loss as a Nash equilibrium of a normal form game; when an institution moves first and the other follows, in a mechanism known as the Stackelberg solution; and, when institutions behave cooperatively, seeking common goals. In the Brazilian case, a numerical exercise shows that the smallest welfare loss is obtained under a Stackelberg solution which has the monetary policy as leader and the fiscal policy as follower. Under the optimal policy, there is evidence of a strong distaste for inflation by the Brazilian society.},

It provides a theoretical framework for modeling foreign exchange interventions at the {ZLB} within a dynamic general equilibrium model. We find a pronounced volatility of real and nominal macroeconomic variables in response to the domestic demand shock, the foreign demand and financial shocks and the terms-of-trade shock at the {ZLB}. This effects become severe in response to highly persistent shocks which leads to stronger reaction of variables and prolong period of binding constraint. The {FX} interventions have proven to be effective in mitigating deflationary pressures and recovering the economic activity in response to all examined shocks at the {ZLB}. In this sense, the central bank achieves the best performance by fixing the nominal exchange rate temporarily at the {ZLB}.},

	abstract = {Following the associated lockdown measures of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the world economy started facing inflationary pressures from a surge in energy prices and supply chain disruptions at the end of 2021. Given the economic environment with low inflation and expansionary monetary policy following the Great Financial Crisis ({GFC}), central banks around the world have built up large balance sheets following the unconventional measure called Quantitative Easing ({QE}). Now when inflation is on the rise, a debate regarding whether to sell off these assets as a contractionary measure, dubbed Quantitative Tightening ({QT}), has emerged. In this thesis, I will use a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium ({DSGE}) model estimated to U.S data and with financial frictions to evaluate the impact on real economic activity from an inflation shock and assess how different monetary policy strategies can dampen the adverse impact. The main findings are that a more conventional monetary policy strategy is to prefer over {QT} when it comes to dampening the fall in output. Furthermore, a more persistent inflation exacerbates the adverse impact on the real economy and the model simulations also show that gradual increases of the federal funds rate is favorable compared to more aggressive increases.},

All machine learning methods outperform a standard logistic regression concerning the simulated data. Among those the Boosted Ensemble Trees classifier yields the best results. We find clear evidence of fiscal dominance before Volcker. Monetary dominance is detected between 1984–1988, before a fiscally led regime turns up around the stock market crash lasting until 1994. Until the beginning of the new century, monetary dominance is established, while the more recent evidence following the financial crisis is mixed with a tendency towards fiscal dominance.},

We use the resulting framework to analyse the macroeconomic implications of three alternative rule-based policy regimes for the small open economy: domestic inflation and {CPI}-based Taylor rules, and an exchange rate peg. We show that a key difference among these regimes lies in the relative amount of exchange rate volatility that they entail. We also discuss a special case for which domestic inflation targeting constitutes the optimal policy, and where a simple second order approximation to the utility of the representative consumer can be derived and used to evaluate the welfare losses associated with the suboptimal rules.

It is shown that, in the Italian case, the government has a stronger bargaining position than the central bank. A comparison is then made between the different solutions to show that the drawbacks that emerge from non-cooperation are not simply those depending on the players' payoffs.

	abstract = {Well before the global financial crisis, the long-term trend in fiscal policy had raised concerns about risks for the outcomes of monetary policy. Are fears of an unpleasant monetarist arithmetic justified? To provide some insights, this paper examines strategic fiscal-monetary interactions in a novel game-theory framework with asynchronous timing of moves. It generalizes the standard commitment concept of Stackelberg leadership by making it dynamic. By letting players move with a certain fixed frequency, this framework allows policies to be committed or rigid for different periods of time. We find that the inferior non-Ricardian (active fiscal, passive monetary) regime can occur in equilibrium, and that this is more likely in a monetary union due to free-riding. The bad news is that, unlike under the static commitment of Sargent and Wallace (1981), this may happen even if monetary policy acts as leader for longer periods of time than fiscal policy. The good news is that under some circumstances an appropriate institutional design of monetary policy may not only help the central bank resist fiscal pressure and avoid the unpleasant monetarist arithmetic, but also discipline excessively spending governments. By acting as a credible threat of a costly policy tug-of-war, long-term monetary commitment (e.g. a legislated inflation target) may induce a reduction in the average size of the budget deficit and debt, and move the economy to a Ricardian (passive fiscal, active monetary) regime. More broadly, this paper demonstrates that our game-theoretic framework with dynamic leadership can help to uniquely select a Pareto-efficient outcome in situations with multiple equilibria where standard approaches do not provide any guidance.},

In the model, aggregate demand is made up of the weighted average of the short and long-term interest rates. A comprehensive set of monetary policy rules is established, all suitable for small open economies, such as Peru. A domestic inflation forecast based rule and an exchange rate based rule are found to work well. Furthermore, international shocks can affect competitiveness and involve co-movements in domestic interest rates. Finally, the estimates suggest that adding the nominal exchange rate to the monetary rule significantly improves the model fit. Consequently, the estimated parameters indicate that international shocks introduced in this model can replicate key empirical facts observed in the domestic business cycle.},

The New Keynesian framework is the workhorse for the analysis of monetary policy and its implications for inflation, economic fluctuations, and welfare. A backbone of the new generation of medium-scale models under development at major central banks and international policy institutions, the framework provides the theoretical underpinnings for the price stability–oriented strategies adopted by most central banks in the industrialized world. Using a canonical version of the New Keynesian model as a reference, Jordi Galí explores various issues pertaining to monetary policy’s design, including optimal monetary policy and the desirability of simple policy rules. He analyzes several extensions of the baseline model, allowing for cost-push shocks, nominal wage rigidities, and open economy factors. In each case, the effects on monetary policy are addressed, with emphasis on the desirability of inflation-targeting policies. New material includes labor and financial market frictions, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and an analysis of unemployment’s significance for monetary policy.
